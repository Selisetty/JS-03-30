JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not provide a class implementation per se (the class keyword is introduced in ES2015, but is syntactical sugar, JavaScript remains prototype-based).

When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property (referred to as [[Prototype]] ) which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.

Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object which sits on the top of a prototype chain.

While this is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypal inheritance model is in fact more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model.

examples:

1)var o = {
  a: 2,
  m: function() {
    return this.a + 1;
  }
};

console.log(o.m()); // 3
// When calling o.m in this case, 'this' refers to o

var p = Object.create(o);
// p is an object that inherits from o

p.a = 4; // creates an own property 'a' on p
console.log(p.m()); // 5
// when p.m is called, 'this' refers to p.
// So when p inherits the function m of o, 
// 'this.a' means p.a, the own property 'a' of p

class Polygon {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

class Square extends Polygon {
  constructor(sideLength) {
    super(sideLength, sideLength);
  }
  get area() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
  set sideLength(newLength) {
    this.height = newLength;
    this.width = newLength;
  }
}

var square = new Square(2);

3)function A(a) {
  this.varA = a;
}

// What is the purpose of including varA in the prototype when A.prototype.varA will always be shadowed by
// this.varA, given the definition of function A above?
A.prototype = {
  varA: null,  // Shouldn't we strike varA from the prototype as doing nothing?
      // perhaps intended as an optimization to allocate space in hidden classes?
      // https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/optimizing-javascript#Initializing instance variables
      // would be valid if varA wasn't being initialized uniquely for each instance
  doSomething: function() {
    // ...
  }
};

function B(a, b) {
  A.call(this, a);
  this.varB = b;
}
B.prototype = Object.create(A.prototype, {
  varB: {
    value: null, 
    enumerable: true, 
    configurable: true, 
    writable: true 
  },
  doSomething: { 
    value: function() { // override
      A.prototype.doSomething.apply(this, arguments); // call super
      // ...
    },
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true, 
    writable: true
